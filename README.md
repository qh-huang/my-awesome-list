## Projects

### Computer Vision & Robotics

#### SLAM

- [Cartographer](https://github.com/googlecartographer/cartographer) - a system that provides real-time simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in 2D and 3D across multiple platforms and sensor configurations
- [RTAB-Map](http://introlab.github.io/rtabmap) - Real-Time Appearance-Based Mapping

#### VIO

- [VINS-Mono](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Mono) - A real-time SLAM framework for Monocular Visual-Inertial Systems

#### Geometry

- [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) - A C++ template library for linear algebra: matrices, vectors, numerical solvers, and related algorithms.
- [Sophus](https://github.com/strasdat/Sophus) - C++ implementation of Lie Groups using Eigen.

#### Optimization 

- [Ceres Solver](http://ceres-solver.org) - An open source C++ library for modeling and solving large, complicated optimization problems.

#### Calibration

- [Kalibr](https://github.com/ethz-asl/kalibr) - A toolbox that solves 1) multi-camera 2) camera-IMU calibration problems.

#### System & Middleware

- [ROS (Robot Operating System)](http://wiki.ros.org/) - A project providing libraries and tools to help software developers create robot applications. It provides hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, visualizers, message-passing, package management, and more.
- [ROS 2](https://github.com/ros2/ros2/wiki) - Since ROS was started in 2007, a lot has changed in the robotics and ROS community. The goal of the ROS 2 project is to adapt to these changes, leveraging what is great about ROS 1 and improving what isnâ€™t.
